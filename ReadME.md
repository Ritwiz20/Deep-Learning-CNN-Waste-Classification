# Deep Learning Model - Waste Classification 

# ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Waste is a significant global issue. Increasing volumes of waste are being generated as the global population and living standards rise. People are increasingly concerned about the production of waste and its effect, and are seeking ways to deal with the problem.

Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling).

 **In this repository you will find the notebook using which you can download the model developed to classify waste as organic or recyclable using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).**


 ### ðŸ“Œ Setup Instructions 

 Run the waste-classification.ipynb to download the model using "Waste Classification Data" dataset available on kaggle.

 ### ðŸ“Œ Run the application

To run the backend and frontend, go through the readme files in their respective folders. 

Congratulations! You have successfully built your own website to classify waste.
